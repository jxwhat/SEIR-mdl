Welcome to my SEIR modelling project! 

# Intro 
This project aims to model contagious disease outbreaks using the SEIR model. 

# Current progress
the .SEIR_basic notebbook provides a model that accomodates basic epidemic parameters: 
- rate of contact, $\beta$
- rate of transmission, $\gamma$
- rate of incubation, $\sigma$
- immunity rate, $\xi$
- social distancing parameter, $\rho$

The next step will be to incorporate more parameters, as stated in the ./data folder.
